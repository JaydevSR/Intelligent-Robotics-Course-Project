## Assignment 1

1. Write functions to	
  • Compute a line between two points.
  • Compute distance between two points.
  • Compute perpendicular distance between a point and a line segment
  • Compute distance between a point and a Polygon
  • Compute tangent vector to a polygon
  • Find intersection of two polygons

2. Assume a robot follows Bug 0 algorithm with left always. Generate an environment in webots and show
the trajectory such that the goal is never reachable.

3. For the following loose pseudo-code implementation of a right-turning Bug 0 algorithm, draw a flowchart
	• while not at goal location
	• move towards goal
  • if hit an obstacle
  • while not able to move towards goal
	• follow obstacle moving to the right until can head towards goal

4. Prove that Bug 0 is not a complete algorithm

5. Implement Bug 2 algorithm on an environment consisting of 4 rectangular obstacle.

6. Create an environment where Bug 2 can be incomplete algorithm and show through your implementation
that it is not complete. Explain why it is incomplete?

7. Use trapezoidal decomposition for the environment generated in the previous question and show the
cells and also the Rebb graph.

8. For a cell in the above question, generate a lawn mower pattern with sensing radius equal to the size of
the robot.

9. Implement the pursuit evasion game for a single pursuer and an single evader for the example show in
the class.
